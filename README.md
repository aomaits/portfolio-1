# Abe Omaits' Portfolio v1
[This portfolio](https://aomaits.github.io/portfolio-1/) is a collection of my top projects. The intent here was to set up an interactive version of my portfolio combining HTML and CSS prowess. This portfolio was built as a responsive, accessible webpage. 

I do not intend to continue to update this portfolio, but to instead replace with a new portfolio utilizing different technologies.

## How It Works
The webpage is responsive and can be viewed at various screen sizes. The interactive features of the website include a clickable nav bar that will conduct users to other areas of the webpage and functional external links to the showcased work accessed via the card screenshots. 

## Usage
While I have utilized this portfolio to showcase my top projects, I am intending to replace this portfolio with a newer version. This portfolio will not be maintained with future updates.

## Credits
The CSS source code for the reset.css document was copied from UT coding bootcamp.
