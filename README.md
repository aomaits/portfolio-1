# Abe Omaits' Portfolio v1
This portfolio is a collection of early projects with placeholders for more to come later. The intent here was to set up an interactive version of a portfolio combining HTML and CSS prowess. This portfolio was built as a responsive, accessible webpage. 

Later versions will likely contain not more advanced projects as well as JavaScript interactivity. 

## How It Works
The webpage is responsive and can be viewed at various screen sizes. The interactive features of the website include: 
- a clickable nav bar that will conduct users to other areas of the webpage
- functional external links to the showcased work accessed via the card screenshots
- a hover display "COMING SOON!" feature for the websites that are not yet developed 

## Usage
This portfolio is only intended for use as in completion of the UT bootcamp courriculum Module 2 challenge assignment. It is not intended for use as an applicable showcase at this time. 

## Credits
The CSS source code for the reset.css document was copied from UT coding bootcamp.
